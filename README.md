Modern ML techniques work by introducing many degrees of freedom in a model and then using optimization technniques to tweek the parameters. We want to leverage the power of ML here and see what can be learned about groups. We can start by embedding groups as cayley graphs. A very simple first question is a graph classification problem: given any finite graph G = (V,E), can we tell whether it is the cayley graph of a group? There are many other problems as well: given a finite cayley graph, can we decide whether the group is abelian? Can we find other group invariants: such as space for which it is the fundamental group?

We begin by producing cayley graphs of various groups. A cayley graph is fully determined by the pair (G,S) where S is the generating set of the group G. Using this definition, we can enumerate all possible cayley finite graphs $C$ by using that fact that every finite group is a subgroup of a permutation group. Thus, any cayley graph is of the form $(gen(S), S)$ where S is a finite collection of permutations.
